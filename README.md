# PGAGI PROJECT 
# TalentScout Hiring Assistant Chatbot

## Project Overview
TalentScout is an intelligent Hiring Assistant chatbot designed to streamline the initial screening process for recruitment agencies specializing in technology placements. The chatbot gathers essential candidate information and generates technical questions tailored to the candidate's expertise, making the hiring process more efficient and personalized.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask
- Streamlit
- Flask-CORS
- `google.generativeai` library

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/talentscout-chatbot.git
   cd talentscout-chatbot
   ```

2. **Set Up Backend**:
   - Navigate to the backend folder and install required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install flask flask-cors requests google-generativeai
     ```
   - Replace the placeholder `api_key` in the `genai.configure` method with your Google Generative AI API key.

3. **Run Backend**:
   ```bash
   python backend.py
   ```

4. **Set Up Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the frontend folder and install Streamlit:
     ```bash
     pip install streamlit
     ```
   - Run the Streamlit application:
     ```bash
     streamlit run frontend.py
     ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage Guide
1. Launch the application as described above.
2. Provide your details or paste a cover letter containing:
   - Full Name
   - Email Address
   - Phone Number
   - Years of Experience
   - Desired Position(s)
   - Current Location
   - Tech Stack
3. Answer technical questions generated by the chatbot based on your input.
4. Interact with follow-up prompts, if applicable.
5. Review and submit your responses for further evaluation.

## Technical Details

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask
- **API Routes**:
  - `/extract_user_data`: Extracts candidate information from input text.
  - `/get_questions`: Generates technical questions based on the candidate's tech stack.
  - `/store_answer`: Stores candidate responses securely.
  - `/follow_up`: Generates follow-up responses or concludes the chat.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **Features**:
  - User-friendly chat interface
  - Real-time interaction with the backend

### Libraries
- `Flask`, `Flask-CORS`: For API development
- `Streamlit`: For building an interactive web interface
- `google-generativeai`: For leveraging Google Generative AI to process user inputs and generate responses

## Prompt Design
- Prompts were crafted to:
  - Extract structured data from unstructured user input.
  - Generate relevant and concise technical questions.
  - Handle follow-up responses effectively.

### Example Prompts:
1. **Data Extraction**:
   ```
   Extract the user's Full Name, Email Address, Phone Number, Years of Experience, Desired Position(s), Current Location, and Tech Stack from this input: '{user_input}'.
   ```
2. **Technical Questions**:
   ```
   Generate 3-5 technical questions for an interview based on this user tech stack and years of experience '{tech_stack}'.
   ```
3. **Follow-up**:
   ```
   Generate a follow-up response based on this user input: '{user_input}'. If no follow-up is needed, just return the string <END>.
   ```

## Challenges & Solutions
1. **Handling Unstructured User Inputs**:
   - Challenge: Parsing varied formats of input data.
   - Solution: Crafted specific prompts for data extraction using Google Generative AI.

2. **Efficient Question Generation**:
   - Challenge: Tailoring questions to a wide range of tech stacks.
   - Solution: Designed dynamic prompts that adapt to user-provided tech stacks and experience levels.

3. **Streamlining Frontend-Backend Communication**:
   - Challenge: Maintaining real-time interactions.
   - Solution: Used Streamlitâ€™s state management and Flask APIs for seamless integration.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand support for additional technical domains.
- Integrate a database for persistent storage of candidate interactions.
- Implement advanced analytics for response evaluation.
